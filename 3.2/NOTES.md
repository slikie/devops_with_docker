GITHUB REPO - https://github.com/slikie/docker-hy
CLOUD URL - https://exercise32-docker-on-cloud.onrender.com

---


was just using https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io as upstream for previous docker on the cloud exercise..

cloned it now at https://github.com/slikie/docker-hy

> do i connect it on github account or try to set it up manually with maybe github hooks?

> try hooks for the time being.

set my repo url in render.com, get new url - https://exercise32-docker-on-cloud.onrender.com

> I guess according to the exercise, I don't use either.

instead, use something like https://github.com/marketplace/actions/render-deploy-action or https://github.com/marketplace/actions/render-github-action



set up secrets.

add the action file.

edit the file, see the result.
