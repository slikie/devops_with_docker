I picked render.com. I had some experience with the other websites - fly.io is pretty well-known,

I have friends recommending it to use as website uptime monitor. However it requires credit card for me.

Heroku is probably phasing out its old Docker build if I recall correctly, while I used to it a fair bit

before, it has moved past it's old free-mium stratagy. So render.com here it is.

I don't have much web-app in hand, the course material is available so there it is.

The source - https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io

Dockerhub - https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/coursepage

Suprisingly easy - login, new web service, put the source in git repo url,

Pick a name for project, specify runtime to be docker and click start.

It automatically use the found Dockerfile existed in the repo.


HOSTED URL - https://coursepage.onrender.com
DOCKERFILE - in the repo - https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/raw/master/Dockerfile
